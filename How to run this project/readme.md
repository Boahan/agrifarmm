## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making farming decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use DEVELOPMENT into precision farming if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.

## MOTIVATION üí™
- Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country‚Äôs economic growth. 

- In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield. 

- In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation and Plant disease prediction, respectively. 

    - In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow. 
    
    - For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements. 
    
    - For the last application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

Now moving towards the admin panel, an administrator has full control over the system. An admin has the right to manage the proper flow of the system. He/she can manage website settings, image sliders, products, orders, customers, and more. Speaking of website settings, it means an admin can update header-footer settings, website brandings, and other website details. Also, the admin has to manage shop settings such as color, size, shipping cost, categories. In-depth, the category refers to top, mid, and end level categories for displaying products. Each product needs to have a top, mid, and end level category just like a host for management of it. In fact, these are the exact point which displays under the website‚Äôs navigation bar.
